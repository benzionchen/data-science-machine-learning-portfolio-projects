    "# Ensemble Learning Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble Learning is a ML paradigm where multiple models (often called \"learners\" or \"base models\") are generated and combined to solve a particular ML problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to build a prediction model by integrating outcomes of multiple smaller models together to improve robustness, accuracy, and performance. The goal is to reduce variance (bagging), bias (boosting) or improving predictions (stacking) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bootstrap Aggregation (Bagging)\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_aggregating\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging reduces variance and helps avoid overfitting, involving training multiple models of the same type on different subsets of the training data. The subsets are created by randomly sampling with replacement from the original dataset (and some samples can appear more than once). The prediction is made by averaging the predictions (for regression problems) or by majority vote (for classification problems) \n",
    "\n",
    "You start with standard training dataset \"D\" with a sample size of \"n\". Bagging generates new training sets called \"m\" (each potentially varying in size). The size of \"m\" subsets are described by \"n'\"\n",
    "- \"With replacement\" means when you take the sample from the original dataset \"D\" and give it to \"m\", you don't remove that sample from the original dataset \"D\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The new training sets created through this process are the bootstramp samples. When n' = n (the new trianing sets are the same size as the original dataset D)\n",
    "- it's statistically expected that each bootstrap sample will contain about 63.2% unique instances from the original dataset (63.2% comes from the formula \"1 -(1/e)\" where \"e\" is the base of the natural logarithm, roughly = ~2.71828) \n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling with replacement ensures that the bootstrap sample is independent from others, since the selection of one data point does not affect the selection of another, each training set can be considered independently created \n",
